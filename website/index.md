# ![](img/pager.svg) Zig Embedded Group ![](img/battery.svg)

This group was formed to document and improve the embedded programming experience with the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org).

## ![](img/goals.svg) Goals

- Provide documents on how to get started with embedded programming (for absolute newbies)
- Provide example snippets for common opperations on certain architectures (LPC, STM32, AVR, ...)
- Provide example worked through embedded mini-projects 
- Create register definition libraries
- Create a common interface/HAL over several architectures
- Create a <i>performant</i> common set of drivers for external platforms

## ![](img/teacher.svg) Introduction to embedded programming

If you've never done any embedded development before, it's a good point to start with one of our tutorials:

- (*WIP*) [Embedded Basics](tutorials/01-embedded-basics.htm): Aims to provide a basic understanding of the embedded environment.
- (*WIP*) [Embedded Programming for Beginners](tutorials/02-embedded-programming.htm): Aims to provide a basic understanding of embedded programming concepts.
- *Coming soon*

## ![](img/community.svg) Community

This group uses the already existing [community infrastructures](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community) that exist for Zig. More specifically:

- ZEG members are active on the unofficial Zig [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TyzJXjser6)
- For more specific embedded advice and ZEG internal development there is a [ZEG discord server](https://discord.gg/zqa3fgv6Ma)
